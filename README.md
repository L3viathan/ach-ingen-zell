# Telling ends
A visual exploration of the spatial patterns in the endings of German town and village names.
I picked the most interesting suffices from [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortsname](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortsname) and cross-referenced them with a list of place names from [geonames](http://www.geonames.org/export/). It's a dataset I always found interesting to explore; plus, this quick experiment gave me the opportunity to play a bit with a few new tools and libraries I wanted to learn more about.
