This is a fork of [Moritz Stefaner](https://github.com/MoritzStefaner)'s [-ach, -ingen, -zell](http://truth-and-beauty.net/experiments/ach-ingen-zell/). The suffixes were chosen more or less subjectively, with consultation by [@sarnthil](https://twitter.com/sarnthil). The data is the same geonames dataset. Please note: My approach is not 100% scientific, as I only match the letters at the end of the string, not actual syllables.

# Usage, etc..

For the rest of the readme, please look at the original repo.
